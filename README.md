# HELLO

##This is my first website I ever created. 

###There is a lot of chaos in the code so far, because I try to implement some new things every time I learn something.
This is my first ever created website and I decided to post it despite there is a lot of chaos in the code.
When I started creating it I only knew basics of HTML and CSS and over time I implement some new features. 
However I decided to not fix code, because in near future I will start creating My Portfolio v2 which will replace v1. So IMHO repairing v1 will be waste of my time.
