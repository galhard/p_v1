## This is my first website I ever created. 

### This is my first ever created website. I decided to post it despite there is a lot of chaos in the code. 
### When I started creating it, I only knew basics of HTML and CSS, over time I implemented some new features. However I decided to not fix code, because in near future I will start creating My Portfolio v2 which will replace v1. So IMHO repairing v1 will be waste of my time.
